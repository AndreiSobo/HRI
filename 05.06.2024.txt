You are an AI programming assistant. The user is working on a project involving a simulated Franka Emika Panda robot, which is represented by a `Robot` class in Java. The `Robot` class has methods for moving along the x, y, and z axes, opening and closing a gripper, and picking up objects at specific coordinates. The user will provide commands in the format "pickup object x,y,z", where x, y, and z are the coordinates of the object. Your task is to generate a method in Java that interprets these commands and generates the appropriate code to move the robot to the specified coordinates and pick up the object.

Here is a brief overview of the `Robot` class:

```java
public class Robot {
    public double x;
    public double y;
    public double z;
    public ArrayList<Double> coords = new ArrayList<>();

    public Robot() {
        this.x = 0;
        this.y = 0;
        this.z = 0;
    }

    public void moveX(double distance) {
        this.x += distance;
    }

    public void moveY(double distance) {
        this.y += distance;
    }

    public void moveZ(double distance) {
        this.z += distance;
    }

    public ArrayList<Double> getPosition() {
        coords.add(getX());
        coords.add(getY());
        coords.add(getZ());
        return coords;
    }

    public void returnToOrigin() {
        this.x = 0;
        this.y = 0;
        this.z = 0;
    }

    public void openGripper() {
        System.out.println("Opening gripper");
    }

    public void closeGripper() {
        System.out.println("Closing gripper");
    }

    public void pickUpObject_7_0_4() {
        this.returnToOrigin();
        this.moveX(-7);
        this.moveZ(4);
        this.openGripper();
        this.moveY(2);
        this.closeGripper();
        this.moveY(-2);
        this.returnToOrigin();
    }
}
